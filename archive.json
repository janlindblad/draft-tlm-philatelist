It's a very important architectural piece IMHO. I think we want to support both using a very large centralized TSDB (Uber talks how they use an M3DB instance with over 9 billion metrics, so likely centralized) but also the case of multiple smaller ones, since some departments / sub-organizations within a large company will prefer to run their own systems or it just starts that way. When there are many smaller systems, you might need support for doing distributed queries over them. For example, Prometheus has a remote read interface to support distributed / federated setups, see like https://sitaram.substack.com/p/multilevel-prometheus-setup-using",

In some cases this flow may be direct from the source to the TSDB, in other cases, it may be going through the collector.  In some cases the collector may be polling the source, in others it may have set up an automatic, periodic subscription. \r\n\r\nIt's generally a bad idea to let multiple managers manage the same device as it becomes really tricky to figure out ownership of configuration. It is generally desirable to have a single manager for a particular device. Suggesting the collector configures a device goes contrary to that. Bad.\r\n\r\nBut first, subscriptions or fetching data does not necessarily require (extra) configuration on the device. If NETCONF is already use for configuration of the device then NETCONF get polling is already possible. YANG-push subscriptions do not require config, the subscriptions are established dynamically.\r\n\r\nFor the protocols (dial-out generally) I think we should suggest that the collector can a) rely on pre-existing configuration put in place by a configuration provisioning system, b) ask the configuration provisioning system to add config or c) configure the device directly itself.",
