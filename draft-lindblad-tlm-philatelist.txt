Philatelist, YANG-based collection and aggregation framework integrating
                Telemetry data and Time Series Databases
                 draft-lindblad-tlm-philatelist-latest

Abstract

   Timestamped telemetry data is collected en masse today.  Mature tools
   are typically used, but the data is often collected in an ad hoc
   manner.  While the dashboard graphs look great, the resulting data is
   often of questionable quality, not well defined, and hard to compare
   with seemingly similar data from other organizations.

   This document proposes a standard, extensible, cross domain framework
   for collecting and aggregating timestamped telemetry data in a way
   that combines YANG, metadata and Time Series Databases to produce
   more dependable and comparable results.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  The Problem

   Many organizations today are collecting large amounts of telemetry
   data from their networks and data centers for a variety of purposes.
   Much (most?) of this data is funneled into a Time Series Database
   (TSDB) for display in a dashboard or further (AI-backed) processing
   and decision making.

   While this data collection is often handled using standard tools,
   there generally seems to be little commonality when it comes to what
   is meaured, how the data is aggregated, or definitions of the
   measured quantities (if any).

   Data science issues like adding overlapping quantities, adding
   quantities of different units of measurement, or quantities with
   different scopes, are likely common.  Such errors are hard to detect
   given the ad hoc nature of the collection.  This often leads to
   uncertainty regarding the quality of the conclusions drawn from the
   collected data.

1.2.  The Solution

   The Philatelist framework proposes to standardize the collection,
   definitions of the quantities measured and meta data handling to
   provide a robust ground layer for telemetry collection.  The
   architecture defines a few interfaces, but allows great freedom in
   the implementations with its plug-in architecture.  This allows
   flexibility enough that any kind of quantitiy can be measured, any
   kind of collection protocol and mechanism employed, and the telemetry
   data flows aggregated using any kind of operation.

   To do this, YANG is used both to describe the quantities being
   measured, as well as act as the framework for the metadata
   management.  Note that the use of YANG here does not limit the
   architecture to traditional YANG-based transport protocols.  YANG is
   used to describe the data, regardless of which format it arrives in.

   Initially developed in context of the Power and Energy Efficiency
   work (POWEFF), we realized both the potential and the need for this
   collection and aggregation architecture to become a general framework
   for collection of a variety of metrics.

   There is not much point in knowing the "cost side" of a running
   system (as in energy consumption or CO2-emissions) if that cannot be
   weighed against the "value side" delivered by the system (as in
   transported bytes, VPN connections, music streaming hours, or number
   of cat videos, etc.), which means traditional performance metrics
   will play an equally important role in the collection.

1.3.  The Philatelist Name

   This specification is about a framework for collection, aggregation
   and interpretation of timestamped telemetry data.  The definition of
   "philatelist" seems close enough.

   1. philatelist

   noun. ['fɪˈlætəlɪst'] a collector and student of postage stamps.

   Synonyms
   - collector
   - aggregator

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC7950].

   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   TSDB  Time Series Database.

   Sensor  An entity in a system that delivers a snapshot value of some
      quantity pertaining to the system.  Sensors are identified by
      their Sensor Path.

   Sensor Path  A textual representation of the sensor's address within
      the system.

3.  Architecure Overview

   The deployment of a Philatelist framework consists of a collection of
   plug-in compomnents with well defined interfaces.  Here is an example
   of a deployment.  Each box is numbered in the lower right for easy
   reference.

            Figure 2: Example Philatelist component deployment.

   Each component in the above diagram, represents a logical function.
   Many boxes could be running within a single server, or they could be
   fully distrubuted, or anything in between.

   Provider components (61, 82, 91) are running on a telemetry source
   system that supports a YANG-based telemetry data server.  The
   telemetry data flows from the telemetry source system to a Time
   Series Database (TSDB).

   Collector components (51, 72, 81) ensure the Providers are programmed
   properly to deliver the telemetry data to the TSDB designated by the
   collector.  In some cases this flow may be direct from the source to
   the TSDB, in other cases, it may be going through the collector.  In
   some cases the collector may be polling the source, in others it may
   have set up an automatic, periodic subscription.

   Many telemetry source systems will not have any on-board YANG-based
   telemetry server.  Such servers will instead be managed by a
   collector specialized to handle a particular kind of source server
   (53, 54).  These specialized collectors are still responsible to set
   up a telemetry data stream from them to the collector's TSDB.  In
   this case, the collector will also supply a YANG description (52, 55)
   of the incoming data stream.

   Processor components (21, 41, 71) are transforming the data stream in
   some way, e.g. converting from one unit of measurement to another, or
   adjusting the data values recorded to also include some aspect that
   this particular sensor is not taking into account.

   Aggregator components (31, 42, 43, 44) combine the time series
   telemetry data flows using some operation, e.g. summing, averaging or
   computing the max or min over them.  In this example there are
   aggregators for Network, Storage, Compute and the entire Data Center

   On top of the stack, we may often find a (graphical) user interface
   (11), for human consumption of the intelligence acquired by the
   system.  Equally relevant is of course an (AI) application making
   decisions based on findings in the aggregated telemetry flow.

3.1.  The Provider Component

   A Provider is a source of telemetry data that also offers a YANG-
   based management interface.  Each provider typically has a large
   number of "sensors" that can be polled or in some cases subscribed
   to.

   One problem with the sensors is that they are spread around inside
   the source system, and may not be trivial to locate.  Also, the
   metadata assciated with the sensor is often only missing or only
   available in human readable form (free form strings), rather than in
   a strict machine parsable format.

       /hardware/component[name="psu3"]/.../sensor-data/value
       ...
       /interfaces/interface[name="eth0/0"]/.../out-broadcast-packets
       ...
       /routing/mpls/mpls-label-blocks/.../inuse-labels-count
       ...

       Figure 3: Example of scattered potential sensors in a device.

   To solve these problems, the Provider YANG module contains a sensor-
   catalog list.  Essentially a list of all interesting sensors
   available on the system, with their sensor paths and machine parsable
   units, definition and any other metadata.

   An admin user or application can then copy the sensor definition from
   the sensor catalog and insert into the configuration in the colletor.

     +--ro sensor-catalog
         +--ro sensors
           +--ro sensor* [path]
               +--ro path?                     string
               +--ro sensor-type?              identityref
               +--ro sensor-location?          something
               +--ro sensor-state?             something
               +--ro sensor-current-reading?   something
               +--ro sensor-precision?         something

        Figure 4: YANG tree diagram of the Provider sensor-catalog.

   Note: The "something" YANG-type is used in many places in this
   document.  That is just a temporarty placeholder we use until we have
   figured out what the appropriate type should be.

   The sensor types are defined as YANG identities, making them
   maximally extensible.  Examples of sensor types might be energy
   measured in kWh, or energy measured in J, or temperature measured in
   F, or in C, or in K.

3.2.  The Collector Component

   Collector components collect data points from sources, typically by
   periodic polling or subscriptions, and ensure the collected data is
   stored in a Time Series Database (TSDB).  The actual data stream may
   or may not be passing through the collector component; the collector
   is responsible for ensuring data flows from the source to the
   destination TSDB and that the data has a YANG description and is
   tagged with necessary metadata.  How the collector agrees with a
   source to deliver data in a timely manner is beyond the scope of this
   document.

            +-------------+                     ___________

         Figure 5: Example of Collector setting up three streams of
            telemetry data from two sources to one desitination.

   Each source holds a number of sensors that may be queried or
   subscribed to.  The collector arranges the sensors into sensour
   groups that presumably are logically related, and that are collected
   using the same method.  A number of collection methods (some YANG-
   based, some not) are modeled directly in the ietf-poweff-
   collector.yang module, but the set is designed to be easily
   extensible.

       Figure 6: YANG tree diagram of the Collector sensor-groups and
                                  streams.

   The sensor groups are then arranged into streams from a collection of
   sources (that support the same set of sensor groups) to a
   destination.  This structure has been chosen with the assumption that
   there will be many source devices with the same set of sensor groups,
   and we want to minimize repetition.

3.3.  The Processor and Aggregator Components

   Processor components take an incoming data flow and transforms it
   somehow, and possibly augments it with a flow of derived information.
   The purpose of the transformation could be to convert between
   different units of measurement, correct for known errors in in the
   input data, or fill in approximate values where there are holes in
   the input data.

   Aggregator components take multiple incoming data flows and combine
   them, typically by adding them together, taking possible differences
   in cadence in the input data flows into account.

   Processor and Aggregator components provide a YANG model of the
   output data, just like the Collector components, so that all data
   flowing in the system has a YANG description and is associated with
   metadata.

   Note: In the current version of the YANG modules, a Processor is
   simply an Aggregator with a single input and output.  Unless we see a
   need to keep these two component types separate, we might remove the
   Processor component and keep it baked in with the Aggregator.

   TSDBs, which they might be.  They may also be different buckets
   within the same TSDB.

   Each flow is associated with one or more inputs, one output and a
   series of processing operations.  Each input flow and output flow may
   have an pre-processing or post-processing operation applied to it
   separately.  Then all the input flows are combined using one or more
   aggregation operations.  Some basic operations have been defined in
   the Aggregator YANG module, but the set of operations has been
   designed to be maximally extensible.

    Figure 8: YANG tree diagram of the Aggregator flows and operations.

   The operations listed above are basic aggregation operations.
   Linear-sum is just adding all the input sources together, with linear
   interpolation when their data points don't align perfectly in time.
   Rolling average is averaging the input flows over a given length of
   time.  The filter-age drops all data points that are outside the min
   to max age.  The function allows plugging in any other function the
   Aggregator may have defined, but more importantly, the operations
   choice is easily extended using YANG augment to include any other
   IETF or vendor specified extensions.

3.4.  The Link to Assets

   In [I-D.draft-palmero-opsawg-ps-almo-00], the DMLMO team has built an
   inventory strucure that describes systems, subsystems and their soft-
   and hardware components.  They are called assets in the DMLMO YANG
   models.  Some of the collected telemetry data streams may pertain to
   quite precisely to these assets, and it may be interesting to see the
   linkage.  For this reason, there is an optional module, ietf-tlm-
   philatelist-assets, that augments the DMLMO structure and adds the
   possibility for an asset to point to a provider or aggregated data
   stream.  FIXME

4.  YANG-based Telemetry Outlook

   Much work has already gone into the area of telemetry, YANG, and even
   their intersection.  E.g.
   [I-D.draft-ietf-opsawg-collected-data-manifest-01] and
   [I-D.draft-claise-netconf-metadata-for-collection-03] come to mind.

   Even though that work has a solid foundation and shares many or most
   of the goals with this work, we (the POWEFF team) have not found it
   easy to apply the above work directly in the practical work we do.
   So what we have tried to do is a very pragmatic approach to telemetry
   data collection the way we see it happening on the ground combined
   with the benefits of Model Driven Telemetry (MDT), in practice
   meaning YANG-based with additional YANG-modeled metadata.

   Many essential data sources in real world deployments do not support
   any YANG-based interfaces, and that situation is expected to remain
   for the forseable future, which is why we find it important to be
   able to ingest data from free form (often REST-based) interfaces, and
   then add the necessary rigor on the Collector level.  Then output the
   datastreams in formats that existing, mature tools can consume
   directly.

   In particular, this draft depends on the mapping of YANG-based
   structures to the typical TSDB tag-based formats described in
   [I-D.draft-kll-yang-label-tsdb-00].

   For the evolution of the YANG-based telemetry area, we believe this
   approach, combining pragmatism in the data flow interfaces with rigor
   regarding the data content, is key.  We would like to make this work
   fit in with the works of others in the field.
